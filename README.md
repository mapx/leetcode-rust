# Leetcode Solutions in Rust [![Build Status `master`](https://travis-ci.org/mapx/leetcode-rust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mapx/leetcode-rust)

A play yard for learning Rust as well as practising with leetcode problems. The problem fetching and testing framework came from https://github.com/aylei/leetcode-rust and evolves different features.

* Run `cargo run`, then provide an id to initialize the template submission file of "problem #id".
* Run `cargo test n{id}` to test the solution for "problem #id".
* Run `cargo test` to test all solutions.
